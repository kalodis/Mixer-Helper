## Mixer Helper by GWARDO420

Mixer Helper is a javascript tool to help streamers network. 
(THIS TOOL IS CAREFULLY BUILT TO ABIDE BY ALL MIXER TOS & RULES!)
When lurking, you often bring up a tab in the background to support 
your favorite streamer or return the favor of supporting channel. 
(This bot is being developed by Gwardo420 for Mixer Networking)
Please check out Sighmir here: https://github.com/Sighmir he helped me build this!

This project uses: "Puppeteer", "JsMixer"

Installing Mixer Helper
(Make sure you have Node.js installed)
1. Download and Extract Mixer Helper to its own folder.
2. Double click "install.bat" to install the correct Node_Modules.
3. Open the Config.json file & Input your Client ID & Client Secret, Save & Close.
4. Double click "start.bat", the client will open a Command Prompt window & you will see your events here.

You can run this when you are live streaming or not, people who type l4l, lurk, lurking in chat will add that person to your lurk list. Doing so will allow
you to support the person that requested a lurk without manually stopping your game to open a tab. It is completely automatic.

This tool was made to run 24/7 to support other streamers while its not necessary to run 24/7, the tool was built carefully to abide by all Mixer Terms of Service.
