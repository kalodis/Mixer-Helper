**(THIS TOOL IS CAREFULLY BUILT TO ABIDE BY ALL MIXER TOS & RULES!)**

## Description:

When lurking, you often bring up a tab in the background to support 
your favorite streamer or return the favor of supporting channel.
*Mixer Helper is a javascript tool to help streamers network.*
Please check out [Sighmir](https://github.com/Sighmir) he helped me build this!

## Using Mixer Helper
(Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed)
**(Find your Client ID & Client Secret here: https://mixer.com/lab/oauth)**

1. Download and Extract Mixer Helper to its own folder.
2. Double click "install.bat" to install the correct Node_Modules.
3. Open the Config.json file & Input your Client ID & Client Secret, Save & Close.
4. Double click "start.bat", the client will open a Command Prompt window & you will see your events here.

When you are finished you can close the Command Prompt Window!

You can run this when you are live streaming or not, people who type l4l, lurk, lurking in chat will add that person to your lurk list. Doing so will allow you to support the person that requested a lurk without manually stopping your game to open a tab. It is completely automatic. (This tool was made to run 24/7 to support other streamers while its **not necessary to run 24/7**, the tool was built carefully to abide by all Mixer Terms of Service.)

L4L: Adds a Users channel to your Lurk List.

!stop: Takes a Users channel off your Lurk List.
