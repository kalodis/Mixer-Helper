**(THIS TOOL IS CAREFULLY BUILT TO ABIDE BY ALL MIXER TOS & RULES!)**

## Description:

When lurking, you often bring up a tab in the background to support 
your favorite streamer or return the favor of supporting their channel. I made this tool
to make it easier to lurk more streamers at once. 

*Mixer Helper is a javascript tool to help streamers network.*
Please check out [Sighmir](https://github.com/Sighmir) he helped me build this!

You can run this when you are live streaming or not, people who type l4l, lurk, lurking in chat will add that person to your lurk list. Doing so will allow you to support the person that requested a lurk without manually stopping your game to open a tab. It is completely automatic. (This tool was made to run 24/7 to support other streamers while its **not necessary to run 24/7**, the tool was built carefully to abide by all Mixer Terms of Service.)
